### Overview:
Adaptibrew is a Python based toolset used to control various processes in my custom brewery. The toolset uses a RPiv.2 processor coupled with an RS485 shield used to control various electrical valves and process devices such as the Omega CN7500 proportional PID controller (used to control RIMS).

### Users/Audience:
 * Homebrewers
 * Programmers
 * Tinkerers

This project is aimed at any tech savvy individuals who want to get into home brewing or are looking for help to automate their home brewing process.

### Components Used:
 * [5- Pack WaterProof Temperature Sensors](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EU70ZL8/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

### Setup:
The newer raspian images do not have the correct settings in the config. You must add the following line to your boot config if it is not present.
```shell
dtoverlay=w1-gpio
```

You will also have to install WiringPi library. The library is at the bottom but here is a direct link to the install instructions. [HERE](http://wiringpi.com/download-and-install/)

### Running:
Simply run the following through a terminal or ssh.
```shell
coming soon
```

### Prior Work and Libraries:
  To install dependencies, run:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
 * [WiringPi](http://wiringpi.com) - Raspberry Pi GPIO library for C
 * [MinimalModbus](https://minimalmodbus.readthedocs.io/en/master/) - Python library to communicate over RS485. Also has a custom driver for the Omega CN7500 PID controller.

### Demonstration
coming soon...
